## Lab 14 Binder
If you want to return to the binder, find the [repository and instructions here](https://github.com/hehouts/lab14_binder)

## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  


```r
#A bachelor's degree is required for this career. Yes, this is a growing occupation, as job outlooks are increasing by 36% in the next decade, which is much faster than the average. 
```


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 


```r
#I feel like I do not know nearly as much information as I should if I wanted to put this on an application, so if I did, I would say my skills are very beeginner level. 

#I know how to build data matrices, clean data frames, manipulate data frames, and display the data using graphs and maps.
```

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)


```r
#I want to be a nurse once I graduate. There is a branch called nursing analytics, where data science is used to find the most efficient way to treat patients.
```

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?


```r
#Creating and using apps have been the most difficult, as there are so many components that must be perfect. It is also hard to troubleshoot mistakes because RStudio won't tell you the specific line of code that has an error.

#Making graphs and manipulating them to make them look aesthetically-pleasing has been the most rewarding. I like picking colors.
```

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.


```r
#I wish I had a bit more experience with using a Mac prior to this class because I've always been a Windows guy my entire life.
```


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?


```r
#While this probably would take more than 1 lab, I'd want to learn how to make apps that go beyond displaying graphs. Like a random cat picture generator or something stupid like that.
```

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?


```r
#To be real honest with you, I don't think I'll be dabbling in anymore data science or coding unless required. While I really enjoyed learning this entirely new skill to me, I do not find personal interest in looking at numbers and data frames for a living.

#My plans? Gosh, I don't even know. Maybe move to the countryside. Live the simple life? Or perhaps to New York. Concrete city where dreams are made of, right? Maybe grab a coffee and people watch. Or maybe take a stroll into an old bookstore and savor the smell of old pages. I'll settle down in a nice cozy house. Live that white picket-fence life. Die old and happy with my nuclear family. (None of these plans involve data science, if that's what you're wondering.)
```

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?


```r
#Working with a partner definitely helped me. Even when stuck on the same problem, two brains working was much more efficient than one. This class can be fast-paced sometimes so my partner sometimes had code that I wasn't able to catch the first time. I felt that I was able to perform more confidently during midterms during the solo portion because I knew I'd have my partner during the second-half.(It's Women's Her-story Month so I am obligated to say this portion.)

#Making this class online would be so bad for me. I don't even want to imagine needing tech help and not having in-person help. 
```
